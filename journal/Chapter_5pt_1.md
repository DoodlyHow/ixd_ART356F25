# Chapter 5 Part 1 of DOET

One of the things that found interesting in this chapter is what they call "human error”, some examples are like pushing the wrong button, forgetting a step, or misreading instructions. it is usually caused by poorly designed systems, not dumb or careless people.
He says that when two people work together and something goes wrong, they usually talk it out and fix it. Machines, though, don’t do that. they just follow commands exactly, even if they make no sense. Because of this, designers have a responsivity to make machines that are understandable, forgiving, and safe for normal human behavior.
