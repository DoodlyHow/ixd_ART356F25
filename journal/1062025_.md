# Ch 2 Doet
The thesis of chapter 2 is that human error is a consequence of poor design and not user incompetence. People tend to form a mental models and emotional responses when interacting with objects, and good design helps bridge the gap on what people want to do and what the system allows them to do. and Norman presents this through "7 stages of actions". This also shows how people plan, exicute and evaluate their actions.

what I found to be interesting was the 7 stages of actions on page 40 - 42 the stages are form a goal, plan an action, specify an action sequence, execute the action, perceive the worlds response, intercept the outcome, compare the outcome with the goal. Another thing I found interesting was how it talks about human subconscious occurs automatically and how a Conscious thought intervenes only when problems occur which is a key insight of intrusive design on page 44- 49.
