# Chapter 4 Part 1

After reading part 1 of Chapter 4 pages 125-141, some things I found to be intresting is that the lego motorcycle is a playful yet profound demonstration of intrusive design and people assemble it correctly with no directions because the design is embeded constraints that guided them naturally. Another intresting thing I found in this chapter was the example they used about Microsoft "instaload" battery and how it embodies how designers can eliminate errors by redesigning physical constraints so orientation no longer matters. some topics I noticed when reading was the physical and cultrual restraints along with semantic and logical restraints mentioned in this chapter.
