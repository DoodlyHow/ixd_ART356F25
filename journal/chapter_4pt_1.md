# Chapter 4 Part 1

After reading part 1 of Chapter 4 pages 125-141, some things I found to be interesting is that the Lego motorcycle is a playful yet profound demonstration of intrusive design and people assemble it correctly with no directions because the design is embedded constraints that guided them naturally. Another interesting thing I found in this chapter was the example they used about Microsoft "Instaload" battery and how it embodies how designers can eliminate errors by redesigning physical constraints so orientation no longer matters. some topics I noticed when reading was the physical and cultural restraints along with semantic and logical restraints mentioned in this chapter. Which were all used to describe how designers use constraints to make an object's function self-evident so users can infer on what to do even without the instructions in their face.
