# Chapter 4 Part 1

some intresting things I found in chapter 4 pages  125-141 is that the lego motorcycle is a playful yet profound demonstration of intrusive design and people assemble it correctly with no directions because the design is embeded constraints that guided them naturally. Another intresting thing I found in this chapter was the example they used about Microsoft "instaload" battery and how it embodies how designers can eliminate errors by redesigning physical constraints so orientation no longer matters.
