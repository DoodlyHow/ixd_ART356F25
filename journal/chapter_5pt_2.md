# Chapter 5 part 2 of DOET

Some of the things I found interesting in this part of the chapter has to be one of the main talking points about how people don’t report errors. even when those mistakes can be common and can be blamed on themselves. it even mentions how people have a difficult time admitting or even reporting errors which I can also admit I have done that at times for small things. It could have been out of embarrassment or cultural norms. Even Norman argues errors should be embraced, understood and improved upon. rather than to punish someone.

Another interesting thing I found in this chapter was how they talk about using logical and physical constraints to help. Some examples were Car manufacturers design different-sized and differently-shaped fluid openings to prevent putting the wrong fluid in the wrong reservoir. and another Example being the Medical and industrial systems use similar constraint-based strategies to prevent catastrophic mistakes.
