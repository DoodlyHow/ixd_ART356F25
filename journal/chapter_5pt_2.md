# Chapter 5 part 2 of DOET

Some of the things I found intesting in this part of the chapter has to be one of the main talking point about how people dont report errors. even when those mistakes can be common and can be blamed on themselves. it even mentions how people have a difficult time admiting or even reporting errors which I can also admit I have done that at times for small things. It could of been out of embaresment or cultural norms. Even Norman argues errors should be embraced, understood and improved appon. rather then to punish someone.

Another intresting thing I found in this chapter was how they talk about using logical and physical constaraints to help. Smoe examples were Car manufacturers design different-sized and differently-shaped fluid openings to prevent putting the wrong fluid in the wrong reservoir. and another Example being the  Medical and industrial systems use similar constraint-based strategies to prevent catastrophic mistakes.
