# Chapter 5 part 2 of DOET

Some of the things I found intesting in this part of the chapter has to be one of the main talking point about how people dont report errors. even when those mistakes can be common and can be blamed on themselves. it even mentions how people have a difficult time admiting or even reporting errors which I can also admit I have done that at times for small things. It could of been out of embaresment or cultural norms. Even Norman argues errors should be embraced, understood and improved appon. rather then to punish someone.
