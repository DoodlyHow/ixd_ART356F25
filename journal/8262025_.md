# Chp 1 of DOET

One of the topics I found to be the most interesting is the telephone which was mentioned on page 19 in the book "Design of Everyday Things by Donald Norman" he states that the "telephone did not happen by accident: it was carefully designed". and more likely a team of people came together to build a list of features that seem plausible and have a way to put them together. I found the phone to be the most interesting because we still use one today except it has become easier to access since it no longer has a wire and a dial that you need to spin.

Another topic I found to be interesting was them mentioning about the door on page 4 of "Design of Everyday Things" I found it interesting because it indicates how we take subtle hints to know whether we need to push or pull on a door just by looking at the design of the doors handle without destroying the aesthetics of the doors design. An example they used when talking about the door was the vertical plate that naturally goes across the door that gives subtle hints to us that we need to push on the door to open it.
